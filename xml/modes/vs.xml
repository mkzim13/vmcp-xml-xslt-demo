    <Description>
        Vertical Speed (V/S) mode allows the pilot to command a specific climb
        or descent rate in feet per minute. The aircraft maintains the selected
        vertical speed until reaching the target altitude or until another
        vertical mode is selected.

        Activated by pulling the Vertical Speed selector knob. Requires a valid
        vertical speed input such as +1200 ft/min or -800 ft/min.

        <Input>Vertical speed value (ft/min)</Input>
    </Inputs>

    <Behavior>
        The aircraft adjusts pitch to maintain the selected vertical speed.
        Airspeed may vary unless autothrust or selected speed mode is engaged.
        When approaching the selected altitude, the system transitions to ALT*
        for altitude capture.
