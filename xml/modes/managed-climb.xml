        Management System (FMS), including altitude constraints and speed
        targets appropriate for the climb phase.

        Activated by pushing the Altitude selector knob when the selected
        altitude is above the current altitude and a valid FMS vertical profile
        is available.

        <Input>FMS vertical profile</Input>
    </Inputs>

    <Behavior>
        The aircraft follows the FMS-defined climb path. Autothrust commands
        climb thrust, and speed may be managed or selected depending on pilot
