<Mode name="DES" category="Managed">
    <Description>
        Managed Descent (DES) follows the vertical profile defined in the Flight
        Management System (FMS), including altitude constraints and speed targets
        appropriate for the descent phase. The mode provides an efficient,
        constraint‑aware descent along the programmed vertical path.

    <Activation>
        Activated by pushing the Altitude selector knob when the selected
        altitude is below the current altitude and a valid FMS vertical profile
        is available.
    </Activation>

    <Inputs>
        <Input>Selected altitude</Input>
        <Input>FMS vertical profile</Input>
    </Inputs>

    <Behavior>
        The aircraft follows the FMS‑defined descent path. Autothrust typically
        commands idle thrust, and pitch is adjusted to maintain the managed
        descent speed. The mode transitions to ALT* when approaching the selected
        altitude, and then to ALT once level‑off is complete.
