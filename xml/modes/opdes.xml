    <Description>
        Open Descent (OP DES) provides a rapid descent using selected speed and
        idle thrust. The mode ignores vertical constraints in the flight plan.

        Activated by pulling the Altitude selector knob when the selected
        altitude is below the current altitude.

    <Behavior>
        The aircraft pitches to maintain selected speed while autothrust

        is approached, at which point the system transitions to ALT*.
